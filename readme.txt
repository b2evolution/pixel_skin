How to change the URL of the Feed Link image?  Just follow these steps:

Step 1.1: Log-in to your b2evolution backoffice
Step 1.2: Go to "Blog Settings"
Step 2.2: Select the blog you want to change
Step 2.3: Go to the "Advanced" tab
Step 2.4: Put your new feed URL in the 'Atom Feed URL' field (you may also want to change your 'RSS Feed URL' as well especially if you are using a service like Google's FeedBurner)
Step 2.5: Click the 'Save!' button

From now on, b2evolution's "?tempskin=_atom" and "?tempskin=_rss2" feed links will now redirect to your new feed URL, the one you just did.
